										<h1>Review of Stefan Heym’s <i>King David Report</i></h1>
									</header>


									<p>Most of us, I think, wouldn’t know where to begin if they wanted to be successful kings. Few would want to be Louis XVI, or Charles I, or Moctezuma II, but David and Solomon top the list of favorability among dynastic rulers. Didn’t David, young and slender, defend his people from the gigantic and mal-intentioned Goliath by sheer astuteness and accuracy of aim? Wasn’t Solomon the wisest of all? These questions do not, generally, keep any of us awake at night, but Stefan Heym’s King David Report should. It is just what the doctor ordered for the times we live in. You might ask how a novel with such a title could be of current interest and I’ll say only that, if there is something of interest in the Bible, it is its timeless description of human behavior. And Heym’s goal is just to bring this out - with witnesses.
                                    </p><p>
                                    First, let’s be clear about one thing: no matter what I write about this book, it cannot be a spoiler. Knowing the mere details of the book will never spoil the crisp, journalistic style of Mr. Heym. No amount of revelation can make the novel less interesting, same as no removing of a few elements from an infinite set will decrease its infinity. Though the story may unfold chronologically, it lights sparks in the reader’s brain that explode in multidimensional threads leading to unlimited reading enjoyment.
</p><p>
Mr. Heym happens into King Solomon’s life just as, of ripe age and sound mind, with a schedule full of events of biblical proportions, it dawns on him that he needs a better job approval, a less questionable lineage, and a clean judicial basis on which to commit all the crimes necessary in order to fulfill the previous two purposes. 
</p><p>
Solomon would not have been dubbed ‘the wisest’ if he had waited for Mr. Heym to take these crucial matters in hand. He already had a well qualified team of master spinners in the persons of Nathan, the prophet, and Zadoc, the high priest - trained sycophants inherited from King David’s cabinet. Whatever did not succumb to the disinformation spread by these two was promptly put out of existence by Benaiah ben Iehoiada, the master of the secret police whose actions seemed to be driven by the maxim: if we kill all of them who don’t believe, all that is left is believers. But Solomon, like many other insecure egomaniacs before and after him, still worried about his image.
</p><p>
Ethan the historian, a reputable writer, is onboarded by Nathan, Zadoc, and Benaiah into the team tasked with pulling the disparate fragments of information and disinformation about King David into a coherent, God-sanctioned, enduring chapter of history. Within the team, Ethan is only the ghostwriter and must watch his own back as someone without any protection from the higher ups should. The deliverable of this team would be none other than the core sections of the Old Testament: 1-2 Samuel. An absolute corker!
</p><p>
Mr. Heym is a creator of vivid, lovable characters: Ethan, the prosecutor type who digs for the truth even at great personal risk, bearing his loneliness like an old lion; his teenager sons, free and funny young pranksters; Lilith, sweet and generous, victim of her beauty; Esther, ill and fragile, who remains Ethan’s devoted pillar to the very end.
</p><p>
The cinematic flow of the novel makes it an excellent candidate for a feature movie: Benaiah ben Jehoiada, ever on the move, surrounded by his mercenary guard of Cherethites and Pelethites; the Egyptian master of the harem, swaying his hips and fluttering his hands, making history from the shadows; Tamar, the lonely, discarded, crazed victim of royal rape and incest; Joab, faithful to the criminal king, who postpones his act of truth until it becomes obsolete and pitiful; Batsheba herself, turned into an elderly icon of privileged elegance, clinging to her narrative in carefully released half-truths.
</p><p>
After turning the last page we not only had a tremendously good time reading but we also found out how to become successful kings. ‘It’s the control of the narrative, stupid!’ Once the appropriate disinformation is put into circulation, the king is finally free to do as he pleases. All that ensues is people’s admiration and a few gilded pages of history.
