											<h1>Books for Special Occasions<br /></h1>
											<p>The best gift you can possibly give to someone special in your life</p>
										</header>
										<p>You have a teenager and you want to communicate those important messages before you let them fly out of the nest. How to do this in the most memorable, effective, and loving way? By writing a book especially for them. A birthday, graduation, or quinceanera gift, your unique book will incorporate your own messages, facts of life, stories from the past, your family's history, or anything that you deem important, in the form of a novel. It will be a real book, a magnificently told story that will remain in your family's future forever. Yes, it is an expensive and unique gift that only you can make but, with our Buk2Buk plan, your cost could be zero or even turned into a monetary gain.</p>

												<h3>Novel</h3>
												<p>Based on your input, several discussions, and your list of requirements, I will write a short novel (approx. 125 pages) uniquely adapted to your circumstances. Whether to celebrate a graduation, a homecoming, a departure, an engagement, a wedding, a birth, or to gather in rememberance of a loved one who passed away, a story written especially to remain in your family's history is a gift without equal. The story will be a real page-turner which anyone in your family or outside of it will enjoy reading and will cherish for its humor, its moral lessons, and its spontaneity. Check out our Buk2Buk program to see how your expense can be turned into a profit!</p>

												<h3>Play</h3>
													<p>What project can be more exhilarating than putting together a play for your children and friends, for your teenagers, or for your musical theater business? You need a good story and maybe a couple of catchy songs. You also have your own ideas for the plot and requirements about the characters - obviously, you know them better than I do! Let me know how to bring your dream to reality and I will do so to great satisfaction. And, with our Buk2Buk plan, you can also monetize this content to others as a play or as a screenplay.</p>

												<p>For your special occasion, I will write the lyrics for your unique song. If you prefer, there is the option to have the song written by a composer and interpreted on the piano or other instruments. Make sure to check out all the amazing options and don't worry about the price tag - our Buk2Buk program helps the bottom lline. But first, think about the one-of-a-kind gift you are making!</p>

												<h3>Poem</h3>
												<p>A poem is often more appropriate for those occasions when a card or a material gift need a thoughtful message to address the soul. Send me your thoughts, your wishes, and talk to me about your situation. I will create the poem of love, gratitude, remembrance, or grief that will remain forever in the history of your life. Check out our Buk2Buk opportunity to monetize the poem and recoup your costs.</p>
