										<h1>In the Beginning... We Were Playing with Chickens and Eating Dogs</h1>
									</header>


									<p>In the history of early humans, the advent of agricultural practices marks a large shift in social and individual behaviors. Agriculture not only enabled people to produce food in a more predictable manner than hunting and gathering, but also to generate surplus food which could then be used for trade or political leverage. The social fabric became much more complex alongside the practice of agriculture. The cyclic and sedentary life of plants and/or the necessity of trade determined humans to settle and organize in villages and urban centers, which led to the rise of ancient civilizations. Due to the emergence of surpluses and increased trade, social stratification and specialization increased the complexity of human behaviors and relations. These developments were slow but very consequential and, from a modern perspective, were labeled as a revolution by G. Childe (Fagan and Durrani 2017:150). Also, they are connected logically so well that the story almost holds. But recent archaeological discoveries are starting to paint a picture that resembles evolution much more than revolution.
<p></p>
This paper will attempt to show that the processes that underlie domestication are connected but not intrinsic to the development of agriculture. Food production is merely one of the uses of the various domesticates, with each of them entering and exiting the food production system at specific historical times for as long as their exploitation as food remains economically or culturally viable.
                                    </p><p>
                                    In her seminal work about the domestication of animals, Melinda Zeder distinguishes several domestication processes, which she calls "pathways": commensalism, prey, and directed (Smith 2020b). The commensal pathway assumes the diet of some animals overlaps with that of humans. By sharing food, the two species develop a bond in which they ultimately find mutual benefit. "The dog is a classic example of a domestic animal that likely traveled a commensal pathway into domestication. The initial commensal stage on this domestication pathway, then, likely serves as a kind of preselection for individuals with lowered flight response and higher stress thresholds - features that make them better candidates for domestication. In this regard, it is interesting to note that one of the earliest morphological manifestations of domestication in dogs is a juvenilization in skull morphology..." (Zeder 2012:172). Indeed, in a famous genetics experiment initiated by Dimitry Belyaev and Ludmila Trut in 1959, silver foxes were selectively bred based on how prosocial they were. Over only six generations, the foxes evolved to look and behave like dogs (Dugatkin 2018). The foxes developed the juvenilization of skull morphology mentioned by Zeder, as well as the crowding of teeth, the floppy ears, the shorter snout, the whimpering, etc. - characteristics which Belyaev did not select for, but happened "on their own". Logically, if the less aggressive, friendlier wolves had an easier time gaining access to human settlements and their food leftovers, due to physical segregation alone they would have selected themselves into dogs. In this way is an evidence-based theory born. Let us not forget, however, that natural sciences are not mathematics and contradictory evidence may yet change everything.
                                    </p><p>
Such evidence may be introduced by the findings at the Pˇredmostí site, in the Czech Republic. Remains of humans, proto-dogs, and numerous animals were found at this site. Radiocarbon dating of at least a subset placed them within a range of 24,000 to 27,000 BP, i.e. in the late Paleolithic (Bocherens 2014). The reconstruction of their diet has been made possible by stable isotope analysis of the collagen in their bones. Animal bones incorporate isotopes of oxygen, strontium, carbon, and nitrogen in various proportions, depending on the animal's diet. Using a portable mass spectrometer to analyze the collagen in the bones (ZooMS), archaeologists can measure these ratios directly in the field (Smith 2020a). Sampling collagen from the recovered bones, archaeologists determined ratios of these isotopes per species and used statistical analysis (Bayesian mixing model) to reconstruct the diet of each animal: (1) the people who lived at the site, nowadays called Gravettians, were mammoth hunters and ate predominantly mammoth meat; (2) the proto-dogs' bones at this site show that they ate or were fed reindeer meat; (3) the wild wolves' diet consisted of mainly mammoth and horse (Bocherens 2014). The mammoth bones found at the site do not have signs of having been chewed on by canids. Moreover, since the dogs did not chew on mammoth bones, it looks like they were not free to roam at the site and may have been tied up. Facial scars show that they either fought each other or were beaten with sticks (Morell 2015). This body of evidence seems to show that the Gravettians may have kept either proto-dogs or captive wolves (note that our explanation does not depend on the settlement of the current controversy about whether the canids were dogs, proto-dogs, or wolves) tied up close to their camp and fed them food different from their own, presumably in order to discourage them from competing with humans over the same meal. We suggest that the Gravettians kept canids tied up in proximity to their camp in order to: alert them of the approach of large predators, deter large predators from approaching by simulating the presence of a pack of wolves, provide a decoy for predators to attack and possibly feed on while the humans flee the site or prepare for defense. If the humans placed the more aggressive wolves/proto-dogs in the path of danger more often, then a Belyaev-like selection happened automatically and non-intentionally. Some evidence in this respect could result from the analysis of dog-harnessing decisions among the Inuit (suggested research). Our suggestion differs from those of the scholarly resources we had access to, but seems to fit the data at the Pˇredmostí site quite well. It seems to be partially supported by multiple evidence of hunter-gatherer communities that fed their dogs a diet different from their own, mostly consisting of their least preferred food (Bocherens 2014:13). This analysis shows that a plausible, evidence-based domestication path exists that is far from being based on commensalism.
</p><p>
                                    Evidence that, aside from being tied up, used as decoys, fed inferior food, and beaten up, dogs were also eaten, is very abundant. Zooarchaeologists have found such evidence at worldwide locations from a variety of cultures and historical periods. Canine bones found at the Ras al-Hamra sites 5 and 6 in Oman, radiocarbon-dated to the sixth-mid-fifth millennium BCE and late fifth millennium BCE respectively, show marks of cuts and charring associated with butchering and cooking (Borgi 2012). Excavations at Ashkelon, in Israel, revealed strata from the Philistine era (1175-604 B.C.) containing dog bones bearing evidence of butchery and processing: "various stages of anatomical reduction that include dismemberment (transverse cut marks commonly found near or on articulating joints), defleshing (cut marks that facilitate hide extraction), and filleting (characterized by a series of short chevron or obliquely clustered cut marks or as longitudinal butchery marks relative to the bone)" (Maher 2017:5). The zooarchaeological research at the Kastro site in Eastern Crete found evidence of the inclusion of dog meat in the human diet: "The distribution of scattered canid bones throughout midden and fill deposits, mixed with other food refuse, strongly suggests that these animals were not sacrificed or consumed as part of ritual. Rather, the inhabitants of Kastro village appear to have made use of all animals for food, including the domestic dog" (Snyder and Klippel 2003:230). At the Hinds Cave site in Texas, a team led by geneticist Raul Tito from the University of Oklahoma found dog bone material in a human coprolite radiocarbon-dated to 9260 years ago. Further DNA testing of the bone sample found that it belonged to an animal that was genetically close to the modern dog (Pringle 2011). These are just a few examples of dogs being used in human diet either as a staple, occasional, or emergency food. Even though it seems like a stretch to suggest that dogs were domesticated for food production, the abundance of cultures that practiced cynophagy for non-ritual purposes places dogs squarely as food on the timeline of agricultural development.
                                    </p>Zeder also suggests poultry was domesticated through commensalism: "Domesticated fowl also likely followed a commensal pathway into domestication. These birds include chickens, likely domesticated through a process of hybridization between several varieties of wild junglefowl in Southeast Asia [...]" (Zeder 2012:173). However, we can easily imagine Neo and Lith, two teenage brothers who went prowling through the South-East Asian jungle and came across an interesting sight: two male junglefowl fighting for supremacy. Neo and Lith crouched behind some foliage and watched the show with delight and engagement. Neo said to Lith: "I think the one with the green tail will win." Lith retorted: "No way. The one with the red throat is faster. If the green one wins, I'll give you my knife with a wooden handle." The red junglefowl soon became a source of entertainment for the village; people gathered in circles to watch the cockfight and place bets. They found betting fun, but perhaps a little more profitable if placed with people in the neighboring village. Soon enough, not only were junglefowl widely captured and bred, but they also traveled around quite a bit, just like sports teams for championships. Any clever traveler could make some money on the road if he had a fighting bird in his luggage. This fictional scenario is plausible and completely devoid of the commensalism factor. Nor does it imply that poultry was domesticated for food production, but for entertainment. But... is it true? Archaeologists cannot tell us if it is true, but they can tell us if it is likely.
</p><p>
Chickens were domesticated in South-Eastern Asia about 10,000 years ago for purposes such as cockfighting, decoration, and display in royal zoos. "Archeological findings have identified at least two main regions for chicken domestication. Early findings indicated that people from the Indus Valley (Harappan culture) were keeping domestic chickens about 2500 years BC. Seals depicting fighting cocks and clay figurines of chickens were found in the Mohenjo-Daro city. Leisure and game were probably the first motivation for chicken domestication." (Boichard-Tixier 2011:198). The popularity of cockfights led to the dispersal of chickens throughout Eurasia and it is only much later, possibly around 300 B.C., that chickens started to be used for meat and egg production (Perry-Gal 2015). Historians seem to agree that since chickens are not mentioned by Homer, their dispersion probably reached Europe in post-Homeric times. Zooarchaeologists have been able to analyze faunal remains at different archaeological sites through identification, genetic analysis, and mass spectrometry (ZooMS). Based on the number and size of bones remaining from each animal, zooarchaeologists can calculate the proportion of chickens that existed at each site. Researchers found the proportion of chicken remains at pre-Hellenistic archeological sites to be less than 3% which points to the breeding of chickens for entertainment purposes (Perry-Gal 2015). Indeed, on many Greek artifacts (vases, platters) cockfights are often depicted, as the sexual connotation of the bird's habits and aggression made them popular in Greek culture. Moreover, for thousands of years, chickens were exotic imports and the trade in fighting birds was very profitable - it was not economically sound to eat them. The earliest compelling evidence of chickens used as food has been found in Hellenistic Maresha, a site in modern Israel, where a large number of chicken bones were found. The bones were radiocarbon-dated to the Hellenistic period and bore marks of butchering (Perry-Gal 2015). "In terms of the number of identified specimens (NISP) the chicken bones at Maresha (NISP = 1,092) constitute 29% of the total livestock species" (Perry-Gal 2015:3). Moreover, the remains of the chickens are in dismembered form and bear cut marks on many of the skeletal parts. This contrasts with older sites where complete articulated skeletons of chickens were found, which is compatible with their use for cockfighting or rituals. The findings at Maresha and the differences from older findings seem to show that after thousands of years of breeding chicken, humans finally started to use them as food. It is possible that eating chickens became economically profitable only after humans were able to breed them in large numbers: the famous Egyptian 'egg ovens' used to incubate tens of thousands of eggs at a time may have been key in lowering the price of chickens and increasing their availability. Unfortunately, no egg oven remains have been found, and our knowledge of these amazing hatcheries remains historical. Mentioned by Aristotle and Diodorus Siculus, they are fortunately still in use in some rural Egyptian farms where their amazing design has survived for more than 2000 years (Lawler and Adler 2012). They can be seen in operation today.
</p><p>
It seems that a lot of archaeological and historical evidence points to the fact that poultry, even as it has become one of the most popular choices on the menu, has not been domesticated through commensalism or for food production and that, in fact, our story of Neo and Lith might actually hold some truth.</p><p>
By compiling recent archaeological research information as well as by making some original conjectures, this paper has used the example of two of the most common domestic animals in modern life to highlight the complexity of interpreting archaeological evidence. In these instances, due to our daily interactions with these animals, our objectivity is blurred by cultural factors. The image of the dog as a trusted friend and companion, that of the chicken as a frequent menu item, induce us to prefer those work hypotheses that remain parallel to these cultural models.</p>
