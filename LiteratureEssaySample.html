										<h1>GLORIA VICTIS</h1>
									</header>

<p>In this post-Dadaist world, it becomes the heavy but beautiful burden of any author to create a new meaning in literature. Like the unwavering hero who must give the Childlike Empress a new name from time to time lest fantasy dies (Ende), the modern author is on a quest for meaning rather than on a quest for storyline and characters. Since its publication in 1965, Pynchon's <i>Crying of Lot 49</i> has been mined for meaning by countless readers, bloggers, fans, and academics alongside its main character Oedipa Maas. Oedipa embarks on this journey of discovery with a vague but real hope of finding a meaning to her life while searching for the meaning of the life of the dead man, Inverarity. The interlacing of life and death is a permanent motif of the book from the bones of dead soldiers that get recycled as cigarette filters (as a continuation of their mission to protect the living) to Oedipas efforts to conjure the spirit of Driblette (Pynchon, 133) in order to re-establish the flow of information stopped by his death. Pynchon seems to be interested in the way information connects life and death through memory and interpretation.
</p><p>
 The Egyptian god Thoth, the son of Horus (order) and Set (chaos) (Mark), makes two cameo appearances: first as the cartoonish image of Manny DiPresso holding a paper cup over his nose (Kohn) and then as Mr. Thoth, a 91-year old resident of a senior home put up by Inverarity (Pynchon, 74). These appearances are like two nails that hold the map of Oedipas world on the wall. Thoth is the one who presides over the judgment of the dead, who invented language and hieroglyphic writing, and who, in a different tale, is self-created (Lucas). The self-creation of Thoth previews modern scientific theories (dynamical systems) that explain how chaotic systems self-organize if they are sufficiently far from equilibrium (Lucas). As chaos is completely predictable, its informational entropy is zero (we need no information to describe it). By contrast, ordered systems possess a degree of complexity that can be measured by how much information we need to describe it. This amount of information represents negentropy (negative entropy) (Wikipedia). The organization of a subsystem reduces the entropy of the isolated system it is part of. Therefore, since entropy in isolated systems can only increase or remain constant (2nd Law of Thermodynamics), this decrease in entropy must be compensated for by an increase elsewhere in the isolated system.

</p><p>
Physicists now know that the Universe at large has regions that are far from equilibrium in which matter self-organizes. Crystals, the shapes of galaxies, atoms, human technology, molecules of LSD, beehives - at every scale there are forms of self-organized matter both living and non-living. An important observation is that self-organization transcends death, flowing naturally from non-living to living matter and back. Moreover, it may eventually supersede Lord Kelvin's idea that the Universe is slated for a 'heat death' and 'descent into chaos' in a manner similar to the one in which quantum mechanics supersedes without contradicting Newtonian mechanics. Pynchon's character is driven by the need to invalidate the 'heat death.' Oedipa searches for meaning and creates meaning out of random information in a frenzy of horror mortis.

</p><p>
At the time the story was written, nobody had built a Maxwell demon except Nefarius. As of today, scientists have built several (Vidrighin) and some of the more recent developments prove the visionary aspect of Pynchon's work. To be able to sort the particles in different chambers, Maxwell's Demon has to measure the energy of each particle and (at least temporarily) memorize these energy values. We remember Oedipa saying with characteristic humor: "Sorting isn't work? [...] Tell them down at the post office, you'll find yourself in a mailbag headed for Fairbanks, Alaska, without even a FRAGILE sticker going for you." (Pynchon, 71)  If the Demon creates order, thereby reducing the entropy, where does the entropy increase then? Thoth, the god of equilibrium, must balance it out. It turns out it isn't the measurement, nor the memorization that increases the entropy of the system because both these processes are reversible. Somewhat surprisingly, it is the process of erasing that memory that increases entropy because the erasing of information is irreversible. So the Demon is an entropy reducing device - which all lifeforms, in fact, are. We can sort, therefore we are negentropic (nice one, Descartes!). Death, however, is an erasure of information and results in an increase of entropy. Unsurprisingly, Nefarius' methodology for working the Demon machine involves some form of conjuring the spirit of Maxwell in an attempt to 'undo' death. But no 'sensitive' can reverse death. Oedipa's attempts at reversing death do not stop here. Her entire attempt at reviving Inverarity's spirit comes to mind: "If it was really Pierce's attempt to leave an organized something behind after his own annihilation, then it was part of her duty, wasn't it, to bestow life on what had persisted?" (Pynchon, 66)

</p><p>
While the world trudged along in its suburban dullness before Oedipa started investigating, it then started to react to the contraction in entropy brought about by her attempts to put order in facts and events. In her wake, the surrounding entropy grows and the deaths start to follow: Driblette kills himself, the sailor dies, her doctor becomes mad, her husband loses himself to addiction, text in books becomes distorted, information turns to W.A.S.T.E. The 'crimes' happen as a consequence of the investigation. In a parallel to the legend of Oedipus, had the search for the explanation never started, the terrible consequences would never have taken place. Had Oedipus spent his life quietly tending his royal sheep, he would not have ended up killing his father and causing the suicide of his mother. Had Oedipa continued her bland suburban existence, many lives would have been spared.

</p><p>
The effect of memory erasure upon entropy is powerfully lamented in Oedipa's mournful inner soliloquy about the sailor's mattress: "She remembered John Nefastis, talking about his Machine, and massive destructions of information. So when this mattress flared up around the sailor, in his Viking's funeral: the stored, coded years of uselessness, early death, self-harrowing, the sure decay of hope, the set of all men who had slept on it, whatever their lives had been, would truly cease to be, forever, when the mattress burned. She stared at it in wonder. It was as if she had just discovered the irreversible process. It astonished her to think that so much could be lost [...]" (Pynchon, 106) Where is this destruction of information recaptured as negative entropy? Maybe in an organization like Yoyodine that "grinds engineers into anonymity" (Pynchon, 72) in the process of producing missiles or in the cartoon with Porky Pig and Bugs Bunny working in a defense plant? Oedipa's lack of direction starts to make sense: how to choose between the "stored, coded years of uselessness" and the "industrial anything"? This is where being Marxist and being right-wing begin to meld into one single form of structure gone bad because extreme organization ends up engendering equilibrium. And equilibrium, Thoth knows, means death.  And death - with the help of the sunlight that is Pynchon's silent partner throughout the story - turns again into new life.  The system must be far from equilibrium for self-organization to happen, for "constellations" to form. And who are Jay Gould, Admiral Popov, Peter Pinguid, Jesus Arrabal - some of them true and some fictional - other than agents who populate the "far from equilibrium" spectrum? They are the named agents of the story whereas the Yoyodyne executives, the shareholders, the efficiency experts, are all nameless entities bathing in the 'heat death' of their side of the system.
</p><p>
Oedipa's apparent paranoiac-pareidolic manner of interpreting information is the most negentropic way of putting together all the observations in the field. To maximize this negentropy Pynchon had to create Oedipa as a character who lives in a reduction of the world, in the cocoon of suburbanity which parallels Plato's allegory of  the cave. Habituated to perceive only shadowy projections of reality, Oedipa suffers from the syndrome of departure from the cave: "Slowly, his eyes adjust to the light of the sun. First he can only see shadows. Gradually he can see the reflections of people and things in water and then later see the people and things themselves." (Plato) Thus Oedipa, like a dynamical system with multiple attractors available, creates trajectories unencumbered by previous knowledge. Pynchon's reader, fascinated by these trajectories, gradually becomes Oedipa, forming more and more conjectures, in a living model of the Garden of the Forking Paths (Borges).
