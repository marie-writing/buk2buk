										<h1>HUNTING DOWN THE ARTIFICIAL</h1>
									</header>


									<p>What a dysfunctional family of words: art, artificial, artful, artistic, artless, arty, artifact! It is, perhaps, the only family of words in which the same etymology leads to utterly opposite meanings. And while art is defined sometimes as the product of a human skill, the result of learning,
observation, and creative improvement, artists have done their best throughout history to undo the
definition of art in so many ways. With every new chapter in the history of art, artists have been
relentlessly tearing at one part or another of the definition to leave ‘art’, in the end, one of the worst
defined words in our vocabulary. Indeed, if it weren’t that art is all there is, there would be mighty
little left to be called ‘art.’ It reminds me of the fable in which Aesop bought tongues at the market
whether he was told to buy the best meat or the worst meat. And, if we think of aesthetics as the
engine of artistic endeavors, we are selecting the tongue that speaks pleasantly over the one that
gossips and cheats. So, there is beautiful art about glorious subjects, there is beautiful art about pain
and struggle, and there is horrible art as well, art that is meant to communicate through sheer gore,
insult, or disgust. And there must also be a Jerry Seinfeld type of art: art about nothing (or Art
Vandelay).
                                    </p><p>Then, we can say that art is simply a form of communication, that two cultures that are completely
different will create art to convey information and that by refining the communication we can
obtain all possible forms of art. But this assumption is rapidly contradicted by the simple fact that,
exposed to ‘artworks’ created by artificial intelligence programs, human viewers were not able to
distinguish 1 them from ‘real’ art. Obviously, what we are missing in the definition is that art is not
only created by humans but also appreciated by them. The act of appreciating art is the end at
which the communication is received and sorted out. The imagination and the creativity of the
viewer are intrinsic parts of making art be art (“When we paint, must we paint everything? Please,
leave something to my imagination!” - Denis Diderot). If AI engines can generate ‘art’ it is as
unintentional, meaningless, and unskilled as the beautiful shapes that one can sometimes see in
cloud formations. Is it art, or does it first have to pass through a camera lens before having a claim
to a title? There is, then, a definition of art that transcends all the difficulties: art is in the eye of the
beholder. Art is not solely created by Michelangelo, but also received by Fran, Serena, Ian, and
Nikos. Art is not just the piece of canvas (or leather) that Whistler painted over, but also the feelings
it arose in some Mary, or George (or Leyland). Without the public art is not art. There is no point in
cooking something if nobody eats the meal. And without its history, art is not art because without
the story of Aesop, tongue, even if well marinated, is neither the best nor the worst food.
</p><p>If we look at art as a transformation of meaning between an emitter - the artist - and a receiver -
the viewer - it starts to make more sense that this transformation can sometimes be elliptic of
either one of its poles. Either there is no public interested in the work of an artist or there is no
artist of some creation that the public takes an interest in. Maybe we can now speak of ‘artificial art’
as the art without an artist and our words would go completely topsy-turvy from here. For
‘artificial’ means something created by man, note applying it to something created by entities other
than human (nature, computers, or the winds on Mars), while the ‘natural’ form of art is created by
someone.
</p><p>Critics, on the other hand, have long sought to define art, to set boundaries and rules to the
communication between artist and viewer. Or, undoing boundaries and rules in communication is
what artists have to do - precisely because art seems to be the communication between two alien
cultures. Immediately as the culture of the artist and that of the viewer have become acquainted, art
becomes ready for a new alienation, a new rupture of the boundaries.
</p><p>Opening John Ruskin’s Modern Painters 2 we find that there are 1,321 mentions of the word ‘truth.’
Following this keyword, we find that Ruskin wanted to see truth in color, space, tone, chiaroscuro,
skies, clouds, earth, in a potentially endless conversion of all artistic representations to the tongue
that praises and soothes. But Aesop’s genius was in pointing out that it is the same tongue that
speaks the false, that gossips and blasphemes, not a different one. I wanted to understand why,
according to Ruskin, Turner was a great artist while Whistler was an impostor (or rather, really, a
con-artist - oh! This word family, how it leads one practically anywhere!).
</p><p>Both Turner and Whistler have invented new ways of applying paint to canvas, of rendering images
that are essentially synthetic: neither one is ‘true to nature’ in the sense that Ruskin’s book of rules
forced less powerful artists to conform to. In hindsight, people say that Turner was a precursor of
impressionism, while Whistler was a precursor of abstraction. Turner took a scene from nature and
rendered it by the fleeting print it left on the retina, in whichever way light cared to activate it.
Whistler, however, like the old masters, bypassed the optical perception to create the scene from
scratch, outside of nature and using, sometimes, randomness as a tool. Ruskin rejected the genius of
the old masters and so he did Whistler’s because, possibly, he was bothered by the artificiality of
both. Though Ruskin claims a foundation of truth and beauty, neither of these lack in Whistler’s
work, for dreams and randomness are from nature too. What Ruskin is really afraid of is the
artificiality of compositions: he wants them to be collections of palpable, verifiable portions of
nature. As soon as this fictive barrier is raised, so do the artists raise who yearn to break it. The trial
about Whistler’s Nocturne in Black and Gold has shown that, legally, artists have the right to expand
the meaning of the word ‘art’ to just about anything, that art is a perpetual act of exploration
beyond the barriers of its own ‘definition.’ People like myself - bankers, accountants, actuaries -
definitely do not have this right, hence the fascination with rummaging sometimes through the
realm of classes like art history. If people like Ruskin would rummage through math classes, they
would probably be fascinated by how ‘true to nature’ math is. Ruskin would have been floored,
maybe even humbled, by the fractal structure of natural forms, by the math that enables computer
graphics to render trees, rocks, and clouds and ‘every dear weed’ from a bunch of starting numbers,
ending with a scene that is indistinguishable by the naked eye from a natural one (more specifically,
in CG, plants are simulated using L-systems). Could we use math to see if Whistler’s work was ‘true
to nature’ or not?
</p><p>While I haven’t found any work on the mathematical quality of Whistler’s work, I have found some
work on Pollock’s 3 . Physicist Richard Taylor discovered that Pollock’s work is based on self-similar
patterns. Subsequently, he was able not only to ascertain whether an artwork was created by
Pollock or not, but also to follow Pollock’s artistic evolution through the fractal dimension of his
works 4 . Further analysis of this data seems to have shown that humans feel safer and happier
within a certain range of fractal dimensions: something between the non-threatening rustling of the
savannah grasses in the wind and the disquieting pattern of light and shade among the trees of the
jungle. Taylor says: "If someone asked, 'Can I have nature put onto a piece of canvas?' the best
example there has ever been of that is 1948's Number 14." Taylor created the Pollockizer, the3
artificial art critic! Whistler would have loved it! Clouds are fractal, that’s why they sometimes look
like elephants. Toast is fractal - that’s why sometimes it burns in the shape of Virgin Mary 5 .
Brushstrokes are inherently fractal, so are drips, splotches, and waves - they are palpable, verifiable
portions of nature. Ruskin just wasn’t looking at the right scale. The deep connection between the
artist and the viewer is, therefore, mathematical. If the mathematics is right, a random phenomenon
may replace the artist and the viewer will experience pareidolia. When Whistler uttered: “I ask it
(200 guineas) for the knowledge I have gained in the work of a lifetime,” he unknowingly
acknowledged the immense body of experimentation that a good artist will go through before the
math is right.
