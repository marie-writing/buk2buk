										<h1>Sherlock Holmes - Superhero Detective</h1>

									<p>
                                      The day when Sherlock Holmes' deerstalker and pipe were replaced by Cumberbatch's stare of childish innocence mingled with the intensity of wild tapetum lucidum surely started and ended with the same question: is the modern Sherlock going to work out? What is it about Sherlock's character that endures? Is Sherlock locked in his place and time or is there something about him that is absolute - defying time, space, and accoutrements? 
</p><p>
It is an undeniable fact of detective fiction that Sherlock's character is by far the most widely known, loved, and imitated one. No character in practically any literary genre has inspired more spin-offs or survived the passage of time, the changes in society, and the ever more demanding audiences as untouched as Sherlock Holmes. We are going to try to answer the question of Sherlock's magnetic appeal and how, or even if, the BBC episode <i>A Study in Pink</i> shares in it.</p><p>

                                      In his article A Typology of Detective Fiction, Todorov categorizes works based on structural elements and establishes the character of the detective as that of a star player in a game of crime. Reading this type of fiction amounts, more or less, to watching sports: the spectator enjoys the game without having to acquire the expertise of the players. A <i>typology</i> reveals the construction of such works but construction alone is not the whole recipe for a successful story (nor does Todorov pretend it to be). The appeal of the story is the object of, among others, Raymond Chandler's <i>The Simple Art of Murder</i>. Chandler notes that "the good detective story and the bad detective story are about exactly the same things, and they are about them in very much the same way," recognizing that the "detection of quality in writing is difficult enough even for those who make a career of the job." So what makes Sherlock Holmes a character that has outlived pretty much every other character created in literature? On IMDb there are no less than 52 movie titles based on this character. Chandler says that "Sherlock Holmes after all is mostly an attitude and a few dozen lines of unforgettable dialogue." If this is true, then why aren't there 52 movies about Molière's Monsieur Jourdain - a character with lots of attitude and more than a dozen very unforgettable lines?
                                      </p>
<p>
 In the episode <i>A Study in Pink</i>, Steven Moffat places Holmes in modern day London, tosses the deerstalker into the box with hackneyed props, and focuses on 'what makes Holmes... Holmes?' Surely, a million details in Conan Doyle's stories are not essential for bringing Holmes to life in movie form. If Moffat only knew which they are, he could place them on the 'optional' list and subtract them at will. But then, how about the details he could add on? Details that are compatible with the character, yet were never imagined by Doyle? Whichever these may be, however, Sherlock Holmes is still a detective. He creates meaning out of scraps of information, out of sagacious observations, sweeping through possibilities and sorting them rapidly much like a data mining AI. Somehow, it seems that the humanizing details that Doyle attempts to endow the character with are but devices meant to cover for the essential artificiality of Holmes. So it does not really matter if Holmes wears a deerstalker or a scarf à la Aristide Bruant, if he smokes or uses nicotine patches, if he reads newspapers or swipes the news on a smartphone. And Moffat realized he would maybe annoy some purists, but not alter the essence of Holmes by changing these details. What is the essence of Holmes?
</p><p>
It is surprising how Chandler surmises that what makes a detective story good is mostly its realism: "realism takes too much talent, too much knowledge, too much awareness," whereas we are about to discover that what makes Holmes immortal is, in fact, his well-crafted artificiality. What Conan Doyle has created, whether intentionally or not, is not a hero but a superhero on the same scale as Hercules, Achilles, Robin Hood, or Spiderman. From Wikipedia, we find that "A superhero is a stock character that possesses abilities beyond those of ordinary people, who typically uses their powers to help the world become a better place, or is dedicated to protecting the public, and stopping evil." Holmes has machine-like abilities in terms of acuity of observation, memorization, pattern recognition, ability to sort through information and making connections. His dedication to stopping evil is also machine-like and, honestly, there is more of the android to Holmes than of the man. His passion for the violin, his bohemian lifestyle, feel more like programming androids to dream of electric sheep (Philip Dick) than like genuine humanity. While putting a smartphone in Holmes' pocket only makes him more awesome or replacing the pipe with the patch makes him more family rated, Moffat has correctly realized that it is the superheroic traits that must be preserved. And he found the matchless embodiment in Benedict Cumberbatch. With the almost white stare of a feline and the multi-pronged conversations that control the flow of meaning among several parties simultaneously, the actor's routine is focused on the superhuman intellectual abilities: "Look at you lot. You're so vacant. Is it nice not being me? It must be so relaxing." For a moment, he sounds like Marvin the paranoid android (Douglas Adams): "Brain the size of a planet and they tell me to take you up to the bridge..."
</p><p>
Many times, when we try to place Sherlock Holmes on a literary timeline of genre evolution, we hear how this character is but an offspring of Auguste Dupin and a precursor of Hercule Poirot. But we never really think why, if the genealogy of the character is so well defined, is he an immortal hero within a lineage of mortal figurines? Was Dupin not clever? Was Poirot not observant? They were, but only within the realm of their own humanity. In creating them to be realistic human figures, their authors followed a literary instinct that was quite different from Doyle's. Used to portraying people, they created detectives that are people, in spite of their eccentricities. Poirot's moustache, always dyed pitch black, is but the vanity of a human. Kojak eats lollipops - is there more to say? Columbo drives a jalopy and wears a scruffy trench coat. By contrast, the eccentricities of Sherlock Holmes are not random: he disregards law if it is the <i>right</i> thing to do (realizing that it was Watson who shot the cabbie, he does all he can to hide this knowledge from the police, he tries to silence Watson who is unknowingly about to tell on Mrs. Hudson's drug usage, etc.), he is very blunt and commanding to people (tells Molly Hooper she looks worse without lipstick, asks Mrs. Hudson to provide meals for himself and Watson). These behavioral traits converge to a god-like authority that is the hallmark of the superhero. We notice how people around him accept his behavior suppressing reactions they would otherwise have (e.g Lestrade demands that Anderson hide his face because it interferes with Holmes' thinking). Whereas the eccentricities that popular detective fiction authors heap on their main characters are, for the most part, random collections of human weaknesses, the eccentricities of Sherlock Holmes are a result of his superhero status. And Moffat makes sure the movie embraces this essence of the Holmes character. He is well known wherever he goes mostly because he has profoundly altered the course of life of his acquaintances. He has a quiet but wide recognition.
</p><p>
While most detective fiction authors focus on describing the detection process: which are the detailed observations that the detective makes, what questions have been asked, how do the answers corroborate each other, and, finally, how the detective explains the crime, Conan Doyle leaves a lot of Sherlock Holmes' deductions unexplained. Very often, while Sherlock has an almost pansophic cognition, the reader (through the eyes of Watson) remains unaware of the stages of the deductive process (due to Watson's merely average perceptiveness). This corner of shadow is like the preparation of the scene in a magic show: not intended for the eye of the spectator. Through it, Holmes remains surrounded by an aura of mystery whereas other detectives make a point of revealing it all before the curtain falls. In the opening scene of <i>A Study in Pink,</i> Holmes sends simultaneous (overbearing) texts to all the participants in a news conference. Asked to stop this interference, Lestrade replies: "If you tell me how he does it, I'll know how to stop him." Lestrade does not know and neither do we, nor anyone. No other character in detective fiction is crafted to possess abilities at or beyond human capability without slipping into the tawdry sub-genre of occult detective fiction. But the semi-opaque deductions made by Sherlock, while not directly conferring a superhuman status, are admirably seconded in this respect by everyone's deference. Thus does Conan Doyle build up the superhero: not by openly declaring him so, but by building a scaffolding of allusions. Moffat adopts the same line of zeroing in on small gestures and reactions. For instance, when Cumberbatch enters the room with the victim, the camera focuses on his left hand. Whether he is just stretching the glove or <i>sensing</i> something, the gesture is meant to hint at the character's paranormal abilities. It looks as if he is <i>receiving</i> information from the corpse, or from the crime scene, but the interpretation is left to the viewer. Moffat has correctly figured out that the mystery in which Doyle wraps Sherlock's abilities is an essential part of the character and the key to his exceptionality.
</p><p>
By using an on-screen visualization of his train of thought - a more rapid and effective witness account than the protracted explanatory conversations with Watson - Moffat continues Doyle's game of fooling the audience into thinking that it is genuinely witnessing a deductive process. Once the audience is completely in awe of the "Science of Deduction," Doyle/Moffat spring onto it small, but significant, impossible feats. Trained by now to believe that what Holmes says is backed by rock-solid evidence and to accept the seemingly magical performance of the detective, the audience is held in readiness to believe that the unexplained feats of clairvoyance are also possible. And thus is the mystical persona of Holmes woven into the story. Seamlessly, starting from a thoroughly well documented (through Watson) process of deduction, the audience is ready to believe anything, as long as it comes from the authority of Holmes, the superhero. Watson, built to inspire the utmost credibility, is not a mere sidekick. The good army doctor is not created solely for the purpose of bringing the audience closer to Holmes' personality, but rather to better inculcate the mystique of Holmes. With his military background, an almost genetic code of honor, his rejection of anything underhanded (he refuses to cooperate with Mycroft just on principle, he cuts short assumptions of a sexual relationship with Holmes), Watson is meant to be the eyewitness, the truthful attestor of Holmes' feats, the apostle of a god-like hero.</p><p>
Perhaps Doyle wanted to create the Holmes stories in the manner of a vaudeville show, casting Holmes as the comedian and Watson as the laugh-starter. But, possibly unbeknownst to him (if we recall how the attempts to 'kill Holmes' utterly failed, how the fandom of the hero demanded its resurrection), the formula of building a solid system of belief ended up fomenting a hero-worship, a sort of religion of Holmes - which explains its longevity and its indifference to context. This worship is what <i>A Study in Pink</i> taps into and seeks to augment. In the movie, the couple Holmes-Watson is closer to a Batman-Robin dynamic, with Watson performing the seemingly impossible feat of shooting a person dead with a handgun from a building across the lawn. The cartoonish artificiality of both central characters is what supports the franchise and successfully modernizes it.
